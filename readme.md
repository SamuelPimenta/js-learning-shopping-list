# Shopping List

Vanilla JavaScript shopping list app from the Modern JS From The Beginning course.

I decided to dedicate more of my learning time to JavaScript, and to start from the basics. This is my first project in vanilla JS.

It is deployed to netlify and can be seen here: https://main--chipper-klepon-1fe845.netlify.app/
